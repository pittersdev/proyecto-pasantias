React Banner does not provide any built-in "sticky-ness" but can easily be 
integrated with things like [React Headroom][1] to achieve this behavior.


## Basic Setup

Going forward with our original example, you would `npm install react-headroom 
--save` and update the code as such:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import Banner from 'react-banner'
import Headroom from 'react-headroom' // Import it
import 'react-banner/dist/style.css'

export default props => {
    // Wrap it around your banner
    return (
        <Headroom>
            <Banner
                logo="My Logo"
                url={ window.location.pathname }
                links={[
                    { "title": "Example Link", "url": "/example" },
                    { "title": "Another", "url": "/another" },
                    { "title": "Link w/ Children", "url": "/children", "children": [
                        { "title": "John", "url": "/children/john" },
                        { "title": "Jill", "url": "/children/jill" },
                        { "title": "Jack", "url": "/children/jack" }
                    ]}
                ]} />
        </Headroom>
    )
}
```


## Configuration with React Sidebar

Making this component play nicely with [react-sidebar][2] is a bit trickier but 
can still be done. You'll need to store your main content element and pass it as 
the `parent` prop to `<Headroom>`. See the [main component][3] used to generate 
this documentation for an example.

For more details please see the headroom component's [documentation][1].
